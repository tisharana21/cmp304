<p style="color: blue; font-style: italic; font-size: larger;">A short story is a short, self-contained work of fiction that generally falls between 1,000 and 10,000 words. 

    Because of this length constraint, short stories tend to be less complex than longer works—in certain ways. <br>In a short story, you can build a world, but not to the extent you can build a world in a (longer) novel. Similarly, you can have multiple fleshed-out characters, but you can’t give every character a full backstory and meaningful character arc like you can in a lengthier work. Generally, long, intricate plots with multiple subplots are better suited to novel-length works than a short story. 
    
    Don’t take this to mean your<sub>finish</sub> short story’s theme can’t be as deep as a <sup>length</sup>longer work’s theme. You don’t need an extensive <strong>one</strong> world with a complex magical  and an entire <ins>system</ins>cast of three-dimensional characters to express<mark> theme</mark> a  effectively. While short stories have fewer words, simpler settings, and smaller casts than novels, they can <del> impact</del>have just as much of an  on readers.</p>
